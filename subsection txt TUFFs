\subsection{TUFFs}
\label{subsec:ANITA_tuffs}

To alleviate the anthropogenic noise observed in ANITA-3 that caused
significant amounts of deadtime, ANITA-IV added the Tunable Universal
Filter Frontend, or TUFF, board. It uses three notches to attenuate
the gain by a maximum of 13dB around the notch
frequency~\cite{Allison:2017vtk}. These notches are tunable but
default to 260, 375, and 460MHz using LCR circuits. Activating more
than one notch and tuning of a notch to a non-default frequency is
considered a configuration. There were seven unique configurations for
the ANITA-4 flight and their activation can be implemented in
\icemc. The response of the trigger for the configuration when all
notches are on and at default frequencies is plotted in
Figure~\ref{fig:TUFFs}. The response per channel for a configuration
depending on the payload time is loaded into icemc and convolved with
the trigger and digitizer impulse responses.
